# Hi, I'm Abhishree! ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸš€ About Me

I'm a full stack developer...
It is very exciting for me to see new and exciting web designs, and whenever I see one I try to replicate it. It gives me great pleasure to create the frontend and backend of a web page, when a web page looks good, appealing and rich with features that are developed through API calls or backend models. After learning about javascript, it seemed like I had superpowers; I could make even the dullest website cool, amazing, and effective with beautiful graphics and animations and with a solid backend. My experience as a web developer spans over two years and I have learned many new skills, and I am still learning and growing so that I can become better, better, and maybe best someday. My experience in Hackathons and College Website teams, along with two internships as a web developer, prepares me to collaborate and contribute effectively. I am also an efficient programmer in many languages like C/C++, Python and JavaScript. I am also a Machine Learning enthusiast and is excited by System Automation and Artificial Intelligence
